# Image Classification

This project use image about forest and fire forest, the main objective was classify the images using the labels of fire and not fiere using a neural network. 
The project starts with the creation of the data base, we extracted the images from the web and then we saved them on individual folders, we started with de redimension of the images so that we made small patches od each one and removed the noise (noise = images with clouds, black and grey),
then we started with the feature extraction we got some features such as:

* Total average of RGB components
* Standard Deviation of color chanels RGB
* Grey scale average
* Contours average
* Brightness average
* Average LAB components
* Frequency of uniform patterns in an LBP histogram
* Mean, Standar deciation, Skewness Spectrum, Kurtosis Spectrum, Edge Density of Fourier transform

We put them on a table and modify as a database, we map the labels, normalice, balance of classes and Train a RNA.
There were made some experiments changing the parameters of RNA like the number of layers, learning rate, momentum and the activation function; we also train with cross validation

The highest results we got were with:
* 2 layers
* 11 neurons
* momentum 0.6
* learning rate 0.4

with an accuracy of 0.89 and a loss of 0.02
